African music has found it's way to the Western hit lists nowadays. I want to research the difference between traditional african music and the African music from nowadays. Are still elements that can be found in both? 

This plot shows the difference in danceability between the traditional and the hits from now. It also shows the mean. I ofcourse need to work more on it. I'm also aware of the fact that maybe African music is way too broad of a topic. 
A line I wrote on my local computer
